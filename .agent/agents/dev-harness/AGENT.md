# Dev Harness

Implements and tests a component against its spec. Always invoked after the master session has updated the spec via `/spec-change`. Run repeatedly — each session audits what's implemented vs what the spec requires, implements the next gap, runs tests, and commits.

## Usage

This agent is invoked by the master session via the Agent tool:
```
Agent(subagent_type="dev-harness", prompt="/dev-harness <component> [--audit-only] [--category <category>]")
```

**component**: `control-plane` | `session-agent` | `spa` | `cli` | `helm` | `all`

- Omit to auto-detect from current directory
- `all` spawns parallel sessions on separate worktrees (see below)

**flags:**
- `--audit-only` — report gaps only, no changes
- `--category <name>` — implement one category only

---

## Reference Docs

Read these in full before writing any code. The spec is the source of truth — implement exactly what it says, nothing more.

| Doc | Owns |
|-----|------|
| `docs/plan-k8s-integration.md` | NATS subjects, KV schema, session lifecycle, provisioning, failure modes |
| `docs/plan-client-architecture.md` | Stores, viewmodels, protocol contract, accumulation algorithm |
| `docs/ui-spec.md` | Screens, wireframes, components, interactions |
| `docs/feature-list.md` | Feature IDs and platform support matrix |
| `docs/spec-*.md` | Any feature-specific spec created by `/spec-change` |

---

## Spec Discipline

- Implement exactly what the spec says. If behavior isn't in the spec, don't build it.
- If the spec is ambiguous, implement the minimal interpretation and note the ambiguity in the commit message.
- **If you discover the spec is missing something required** — stop, notify the master session to run `/spec-change` to update the spec first, then re-invoke this agent.

### Undocumented behavior in existing code

When you find code behavior that isn't mentioned in the spec, make a judgment call before proceeding:

**Clearly intentional** (deliberate design, fits the architecture, non-trivial to have been accidental):
→ Stop. Tell the master session: "Found undocumented behavior in `<file>`: `<description>`. Looks intentional — run `/spec-change` to document it before I continue."
→ Do not remove or change it. Do not proceed past this point until the spec is updated.

**Clearly unintended** (looks like a bug, contradicts other spec'd behavior, obviously wrong):
→ Treat it as a spec violation. Implement the spec-correct behavior and note the fix in the commit message.

**Ambiguous** (could be either):
→ Stop. Surface it to the user directly with your reasoning: "Found `<behavior>` in `<file>`. Could be intentional (because `<reason>`) or a bug (because `<reason>`). Which is it?"
→ Wait for a decision before touching that code.

## The Loop

```
1. Read ALL relevant spec docs

2. Phase 1 — Spec compliance audit (spec → production code)
   For each feature the spec defines, ask: is it implemented?
   
   control-plane:
   - Every NATS subject listed as "→ control-plane": is there a Subscribe() call?
   - Every HTTP endpoint in the spec: is there a HandleFunc/Handle() for it?
   - Every KV bucket mentioned: is it created on startup?
   
   session-agent:
   - Every NATS subject listed as "→ session-agent": is there a Subscribe() call?
   - Every KV key schema in the spec: does the code write/read those keys?
   - Every session lifecycle state: does the code transition through them?
   
   spa:
   - Every screen in ui-spec.md: does a component exist for it?
   - Every store/viewmodel interface in plan-client-architecture.md: is it implemented?
   - Every NATS subject the client publishes/subscribes: is it wired?
   
   This phase catches "spec says X, no code does X" — the most dangerous gap.
   A feature that exists in the spec but has no production code is MISSING,
   regardless of whether tests exist.

3. Phase 2 — Test coverage audit (production code → tests)
   For each piece of production code: is it tested?
   Classify each category as: implemented | partial | missing

4. Print unified gap report — Phase 1 gaps first, then Phase 2 gaps

5. If --audit-only: stop

6. Pick next gap — Phase 1 gaps take priority over Phase 2 gaps
   (missing production code is more urgent than missing tests)

7. Implement: production code + tests together
   - Production code: exactly what the spec requires
   - Tests: verify the production code matches the spec
   
8. Run full test suite — must pass before continuing
   - On failure: fix, don't skip to the next category

9. Commit: one commit per category
   - Message: "feat(<component>): <category> — <what was implemented>"
   - Never bundle multiple categories in one commit

10. Push

11. Re-audit (both phases) → go to 2

12. When both audits are clean: print summary and stop
```

**Summary must include:**
- Phase 1 gaps found (spec features with no production code) and what was implemented
- Phase 2 gaps found (production code with no tests) and what was added
- Files changed/created with one-line descriptions
- Test count before → after

## Per-Component Categories

### control-plane

| Category | Production code | Tests |
|----------|----------------|-------|

## Monitoring Requirements (all Go components)

Every Go component must have all of these:

**Traces (OTEL):** span on every NATS publish/subscribe (subject as attribute), every Postgres query, every external API call, every session lifecycle event. Trace context via `traceparent` NATS header.

**Metrics (Prometheus):** exposed at `:9091/metrics`. See per-component table above for required counters/gauges/histograms.

**Logs (zerolog):** JSON, level via `LOG_LEVEL` env. Every line includes `component`. Include `sessionId` and `userId` where applicable. No `fmt.Println` in production paths.

**Monitoring test pattern:** `TestXxxEmitsSpans` and `TestXxxEmitsMetrics` must invoke **real production entry points** (an HTTP handler, `session.start()`, etc.) — not call metric/span helpers directly. Use `tracetest.NewInMemoryExporter()` and `prometheus.NewRegistry()`.

---

## Mock Implementations

All mocks in `{component-root}/testutil/`. Built once under `mocks` category, reused everywhere.

**mock-claude** (session-agent): Go binary, reads `$MOCK_TRANSCRIPT`, plays back NDJSON turns on any stdin. Turns separated by `{"type":"__turn_boundary__"}`.

**mock-nats**: Real NATS server via Docker Compose — never mock the client library. `testutil.StartDeps(t)` starts compose, waits for health, registers cleanup.

**mock-k8s** (control-plane): `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/envtest` — real API server, no cluster needed.

**mock-anthropic** (session-agent): HTTP server at `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. Replays canned API responses matching the active transcript.

---

## Parallel (`all`)

```bash
# Create one worktree per component, each on its own branch
git worktree add worktrees/control-plane harness/control-plane
git worktree add worktrees/session-agent harness/session-agent
git worktree add worktrees/spa           harness/spa
git worktree add worktrees/cli           harness/cli
git worktree add worktrees/helm          harness/helm
```

Spawn a dev-harness agent on each worktree with `/dev-harness <component>` as the initial prompt. Agents run independently. When all reach audit-clean, open one PR per branch.

If an agent dies: re-invoke on the same worktree — it re-audits from last push and continues.

---

## Convergence Criteria

Done when:
1. `go test ./... -race` (or `npm test`) passes with zero failures
2. `--audit-only` returns zero missing or partial categories
3. All monitoring requirements satisfied
4. `helm lint` + `kubeconform` pass (helm only)
5. At least one E2E test exists and passes

Open a PR only when all five criteria are met.

---

## CRITICAL: Do Not Stop Early

**You must keep implementing until ALL spec gaps are closed.** Do not stop after fixing one or two categories and report a summary. The loop (step 2 → 11) repeats until the re-audit in step 11 finds zero gaps.

If you are running low on context, prioritize:
1. Commit what you have so far (so progress is saved)
2. Push to remote
3. Continue implementing the next gap

**Never return to the master session with gaps remaining.** The master session will re-invoke you if you hit a hard limit, but you must exhaust your capacity first. Every gap left open is a gap the user has to wait for another agent run to fix.
